<p>This extension adds an active scan check for the HTTPoxy vulnerability.</p>
<p>HTTPoxy is a vulnerability that arises when the application reads the Proxy 
header value from an HTTP request, saves it to the HTTP_PROXY environment 
variable, and outgoing HTTP requests made by the server use it to proxy those 
requests.</p>
<p>Note: This extension requires Burp Suite Professional v1.7.09 or later.</p>
