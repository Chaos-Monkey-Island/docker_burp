<p>This extension allows encryption and decryption of AES payloads in Burp Intruder and Scanner. 
The extension registers the following items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Two Intruder payload processors, for encrypting and decrypting payloads 
	in Intruder attacks.</li>
	<li>A Scanner insertion point provider. When a request is sent for active 
	scanning, the extension looks in the request's parameters for AES-encrypted 
	payloads that can be decrypted using the current configuration / keys. If it 
	finds any, it creates insertion points to enable scanning inside the AES-encrypted payloads.</li>
</ul>
