<p>This extension provides a customizable payload generator, suitable for 
detecting a variety of file path vulnerabilities in file upload and download 
functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>File upload vulnerable to path traversal with the upload directory located inside the document root.</li>
  <li>File upload vulnerable to path traversal with the upload directory outside the document root.</li>
  <li>File upload not vulnerable to path traversal, but having the upload directory is inside of the document root, with no direct links to the uploaded file exposed by the application.</li>
  <li>Local file inclusion/arbitrary file read vulnerable to path traversal with non-recurrent filters involved.</li>
</ul>
